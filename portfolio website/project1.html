                    <div class="project1des"> I chose a dreamcatcher as my object because it's an interesting object that has a lot of meaning and history. My idea was to research the dreamcatcher and use the information gathered to create my visuals. I wanted to make these conceptual ideas visible through my compositons. </div>

                   <h3>Process</h3>
                   <div class="project1des">After I concluded my research, I began with dissecting parts of the dreamcatcher and repeating them in paint, marker, charcoal, ink, crayons, etc,. I experimented with this media until I was satisfied. I then moved to experimenting with types of backgrounds like different types of paper, and canvas. I combined these compositions until I achieved the most meaningful pieces. When the pieces were done, I transfer them to my computer where I manipulated them to make them even better. Using photoshop and Illustrator I was able to incorporate photography and typography along with other ideas that surged through the process. </div>
