                   <h3>Objective</h3>
                   <div class="project1des"> For this project, I was instructed to make a splurchase using only $10. After buying the product, I was to research and analyze the design and marketing aspects of it to then find the cons and pros of the product. When these problems where identified I was to set a goal that would let me to solve the problems encountered.  </div>

               <div class="tabs__content">
                    <h3 >My idea</h3>
                    <div class="project1des"> For my splurchase, I selected a Chinese candy product for kids called chocolate cups. This product caught my attention because of the way it was packaged in a bucket containing a large amount of the actual product. Another factor that caused me to purchase it, was the car toy in the inside which made me wonder if there was a way this toy could interact with the product or the packaging. I noticed that the car toy felt alone in the product because there wasn't anything that could relate to the idea of cars in the packaging except for a photo of the car in the front. With this in mind, I set a goal to begin my redesign: <em>to create a fun design for kids while creating packaging that uses less plastic and is safe for kids.</em>  </div>

               <input type="radio" class="tabs__radio" id="tabresults" name="tabs-example" >

               <div class="tabs__content">
                   <h3>Process</h3>
                   <div class="project1des">I began by designing the packging net that would be the best solution for the encountered problems. After several tries, I finally decided on the packaging, which would be one that is smaller, uses cardstcok material and is interesting. The next step was to start on the graphics so I began by keeping the original colors of the product which I believe were important for the identity of the product. For the design, I opted to illustrate the toy car in the front along with illutrations of the product that interact with the toy. On one side of the box, I designed a race track because it would achieve one of my goals and I thought it could be fun for kids.   </div>
